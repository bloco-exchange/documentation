# Gamification: Engaging Users and Rewarding Activity

Bloco.exchange recognizes the importance of user engagement and aims to create an enjoyable and immersive experience through gamification. By integrating game-like elements into the platform, users can earn points and rewards for their activities, fostering a sense of achievement and encouraging continued participation. The following section elaborates on the gamification features and point-earning opportunities on the exchange.

## Earning Points

Users can accumulate points by participating in various activities on the exchange. These points can later be redeemed for rewards, such as discounts on trading fees, access to premium features, or even converted into the native currency, blocs (â¨–). Points can be earned through:

1. **Trading**: Users can earn points for every trade they execute on the exchange. The more they trade, the more points they accumulate.
2. **Investing**: By investing in different assets or participating in initial token offerings, users can earn points based on their investment amounts.
3. **Staking**: Users who stake their tokens or provide liquidity to the platform can earn points based on the duration and amount of their staked assets.

## Leaderboard and Achievements

To create a sense of friendly competition and showcase user accomplishments, Bloco.exchange will feature a leaderboard that ranks users based on their point totals. Users can climb the ranks by actively participating in the platform and accumulating points. Additionally, the platform will include a system of achievements that users can unlock by reaching specific milestones, such as executing a certain number of trades or staking a specific amount of tokens.

## Reward Tiers and Benefits
