## 1inch Integration in bloco.exchange

Bloco.exchange integrates 1inch, a leading decentralized exchange aggregator, to provide a seamless experience for users trading tokens and placing limit orders across Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) networks. The integration ensures that users have access to the best exchange rates and lowest slippage while trading.

### Limit Orders with 1inch

For limit orders, bloco.exchange utilizes the 1inch Limit Order Protocol. This allows users to place limit orders for token pairs and execute trades when the desired price is reached. The interactive agent on the platform can understand and process user requests for placing limit orders in natural language, making it a smooth experience for the users.

To place a limit order, users can simply communicate their intentions to the interactive agent. For example, a user can say, "Buy 10 ADA when the price goes up by 10%." The interactive agent will then parse the user's request, process the information, and create a limit order using the 1inch Limit Order Protocol.

### Token Swaps with 1inch

Bloco.exchange uses the 1inch API to enable users to swap tokens across ETH and BSC networks. The integration provides users with the best swap rates and minimal slippage by aggregating multiple decentralized exchanges.

To initiate a token swap, users can communicate their intentions to the interactive agent in natural language. For example, a user can say, "Swap 50% of my FLOKI for PEPE." The interactive agent will then process the user's request and execute the token swap using the 1inch API.
