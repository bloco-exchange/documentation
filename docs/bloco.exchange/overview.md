# Overview

bloco.exchange is a web3 platform that allows the user to interact with natural language using interactive agents, but it facilitates users with a lot more than just that.

Every user has a dedicated personalised intelligent agent who may act and operate on behalf of the user to navigate markets, to trade and to invest, to interact with and retrieve market information to make good decisions and more.

## Fundamentals

bloco.exchange has 4 pillars:

1. **Keys**: Custody and Authorization. Keys and funds in the hands of their rightful owners.
2. **IDs**: Identification and Authentication. Login with Web3 for privacy and security.
3. **AI**: Intelligent and Intuitive. Interactive technology to enrich, empower and delegate decision making.
4. **Borderless**: Accessible and Worldwide. Investment, trading and commerce by innovating and breaking barriers.

## Subscription Types

The platform has two subscription types (which are managed by smart-contracts linked to wallet addresses): Essential and Elite. Each have their benefits.

## Interactive Agents

Interactive agents can dynamically create UI components based on the interaction, instructions, requests, etc.

## Language Support

The platform supports any language thanks to the interaction and the power of the interactive agents, not much has to be done extra for this. We use OpenAI APIs in combination with libraries to handle interactions, context understanding, and operations by AI.

## DeFi Protocols

The platform leverages various DeFi protocols such as ERC 4337.

## Gamification

The platform is gamified based on user activity on the exchange, and a list of actions, trades, activities, leaderboard, etc. and rewards the user might receive. This is adaptable over time such that the platform can continue to introduce more rewards. Rewards are in the form of points, which have monetary value at later stages of the platform.

## Native Currency

The platform will run on the native currency called blocs (⨖), which needs to be developed.

## Dividends

The notion of dividends are deeply engrained into the exchange, the currency, subscriptions and any other revenue streams that the platform makes. In addition to that, official token listings and holders will be able to benefit from dividend mechanisms. Dividends distribute percentages of subscription fees and revenues to investors, apart from that, there are various additional dividend features to keep investors interested, engaged, and to reward contributions, etc., such as:

- **Dividend Boosters**: Dividend boosters are dividend features that temporarily increase the dividend yield for users who participate in certain platform activities, such as providing liquidity, referring new users, or participating in governance decisions. These boosters incentivize user engagement and help drive platform growth.

- **Dividend-Linked NFTs**: Dividend-Linked NFTs integrate non-fungible tokens that grant holders unique dividend privileges, such as increased dividend payouts, exclusive access to high-yield pools, or early access to new dividend-earning opportunities. These NFTs can be traded, staked, or used as collateral, driving additional utility for the native ERC20 token (⨖).

- **Tokenized Dividend Rights**: Tokenized dividend rights represent a claim on a portion of the platform's future dividend payouts. Users can trade these rights in a secondary market, providing an additional layer of liquidity and flexibility for managing dividend income.

- **Tiered Dividends**: A tiered dividend system categorizes users based on the amount of the native ERC20 token (⨖) held in their wallets. Higher tiers receive a higher percentage of dividends, incentivizing users to accumulate and hold more tokens.

## Future Innovations

- **Decentralized Autonomous Index Fund (DAIF)**: DAIFs are smart-contract-based funds that are managed by a community of investors, rather than a centralized entity. These funds can invest in a diversified portfolio of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and commodities. DAIFs use blockchain technology to automate the management and rebalancing of the portfolio, ensuring transparency and security. For certain DAIFs, they generate management fees, which are used to compensate the fund managers and incentivize them to make profitable investment decisions. These fees are usually charged as a percentage of the total assets under management and can vary based on the complexity and risk of the portfolio.

- **MultiSigDAIF Smart-Contract**: A MultiSigDAIF smart-contract is a decentralized autonomous index fund (DAIF) smart contract designed to enable a group of investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets. The contract allows for management by an optional fund manager or investor consensus. It features an automatic and manual stop-loss mechanism to mitigate risk, and a reputation management system for fund managers.

- **Blocs (⨖) Payment Gateway**: For the future, we will develop a Blocs (⨖) Payment Gateway for e-commerce platforms, enabling merchants to accept Blocs (⨖) as payment for goods and services, driving real-world adoption and utility.

## Referral Dashboard

Lastly, an important aspect of the first release of the platform is the referral dashboard. Referrals allow people that are supporting the exposure of the platform to enjoy a portion of the fees of each subscription made on the platform. On the specialized dashboard, referrers can create their unique referral code, but importantly, they are facilitated with the latest and up-to-date information about the platform such that they can appropriately inform everyone they contact in relation to becoming a subscribed member. We facilitate the referrer with elaborate marketing content to share with people in addition to a specialized marketing and referring intelligent agent that helps referrers make the right choices, share the right information, and best support closing deals. Referrers enjoy 10% of each subscription by referral, and can see their earnings on the dashboard. Well-performing referrers are able to earn a monthly wage just by referring people to the platform if the new members use their referral code.
